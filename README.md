# HavenSaveEditor

Save Editor for Haven.

Currently only decrypts save file and has GUI for changing character genders

Download from the releases section on the right ->

Run the .EXE

Select your save file (C:\Users\\\<USER>\AppData\LocalLow\TheGameBakers\Haven\GameSlot_00\Save.json)

The three boxes at the bottom should populate with the current character gender values e.g. ^WW WW 2

If not somethings broken, ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

Select gender pair in dropdown

Hit save

Don't open the same save file twice in a row without going into the game and saving

This decrypts the save file but doesn't re-encrypt it. The game will load the decrypted save file and re-encrypt on the next save
