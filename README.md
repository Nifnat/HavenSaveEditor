# HavenSaveEditor

Save Editor for Haven.
Currently only decrypts save file and has GUI for changing character genders
Download from the releases section on the right ->
Run the .EXE
Select your save file (C:\Users\<USER>\AppData\LocalLow\TheGameBakers\Haven\GameSlot_00\Save.json)
Select gender pair in dropdown

Don't open the same save file twice in a row without going into the game and saving
This decrypts the save file but doesn't re-encrypt it. The game will load the decrypted save file and re-encrypt on the next save
